# Drum Player Game
Made using HTML,CSS and Javascript.

### About the project 
- It is a very basic project created while learning javacript.
- I learned it from this [course](https://javascript30.com/).
- But I used a gif in my project to show a drum player in it.

**Improvements**
- Currently I'm learning CSS stuffs and making UIs in it.
- I thought that this project can be improved more by including some styling.
- The gif should not play continously untill any key is not pressed.
- That would make it more realistic.
- I searched about it but didn't found any thing to add control in gif as it is rendered in `img` tag.
- That's why I converted `gif` in to a video and rendered the video and added some basic functionalities using javascript.
